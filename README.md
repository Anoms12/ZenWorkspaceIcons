# ZenWorkspaceIcons
This acts as a way for the comunity to contribute key words for the search feature of workspace icons.

## how to contribute
I want the keywords to be simple and in the context of it being a workspace icon (this is why I want the comunities contributions). Essentialy consider what key words you would look up in your search for that emoji or key words you might use to find emojies in your specific use cases.

for example this emoji: "ðŸ“–" 
```json
{
    "emoji": "ðŸ“–",
    "description": "school, english, literature, reading, language arts, study, essays, writing, homework"
  },
```

ive made this format for a [chatgpt conversation](https://chatgpt.com/share/675e4f8f-8800-800a-b4ad-c834855347a0)
i would like for people to think about there own use cases as i could use chatgpt myself but if you just want to help label this would still be sufficient.
